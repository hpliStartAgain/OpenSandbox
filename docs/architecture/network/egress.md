# Egress

Egress is how a sandbox gets a network policy instead of open internet access. It runs as a sidecar sharing the sandbox's network namespace, so every outbound packet passes it — no application configuration, and no way around it from inside the sandbox. Policy is declared at create time (`networkPolicy`) or by the platform, and enforced continuously.

## Capabilities at a glance

| Capability | What you get |
|---|---|
| FQDN rules | Allow or deny by domain, wildcard (`*.pypi.org`), IP, or CIDR |
| DNS filtering (default) | Denied domains fail resolution; allowed ones resolve normally |
| Network enforcement (`dns+nft`) | Strict default-deny at the packet layer, fed by DNS-resolved addresses with bounded leases |
| Platform overlays | Operator-set `deny.always` / `allow.always` floors that user policy cannot override |
| Credential Vault | Secrets stay in the sidecar; credentials are injected into matching outbound requests |
| Transparent TLS interception (L7) | See, control, and authenticate outbound HTTPS — production-usable mechanism, experimental configuration surface |
| Fail-closed startup | If enforcement cannot be installed, the sidecar exits — it never runs as a no-op |

## How interception works

**Layer 1 — DNS.** All port-53 traffic is redirected into the sidecar's DNS proxy. A denied domain answers `NXDOMAIN`; an allowed domain resolves through to the real upstream, and its resolved addresses are recorded.

**Layer 2 — Network (`dns+nft` mode).** nftables drops everything not explicitly allowed. Allowed traffic passes by static rule or by DNS-learned address sets: a resolved IP receives a bounded lease (with a grace window for active TCP connections), so "allowed" never silently becomes "allowed forever". UDP and QUIC flows rely on DNS lease timing alone.

**Precedence.** First matching rule wins, in this order: platform `deny.always`, platform `allow.always`, then your policy — so the platform's deny always beats your allow. The overlays live in files inside the sidecar image and hot-reload every minute. A reload publishes the parsed pair only after the corresponding nftables static policy is accepted; parse or apply failures keep the active in-memory rules. Failures remain eligible for retry unless the experimental revision runtime requires recovery, as described below. Your policy is set per sandbox and can be mutated at runtime (add, replace, remove by target) through the API the SDKs expose.

## Design decisions

**Enforcement lives in the data path, not beside it.** The sidecar shares the sandbox's network namespace and installs redirect rules there, so every packet passes the policy engine without application cooperation — and without the option to bypass it, because the workload holds no `NET_ADMIN` in that namespace.

**Two layers, two costs.** DNS filtering alone is cheap and universal, but it only gates names: an application that obtains an address by other means is not covered. The `dns+nft` layer adds packet-level truth — default-deny with DNS-learned exceptions that carry bounded leases (renewed while a TCP connection is active), so "allowed" never quietly becomes "allowed forever".

**Encrypted DNS is treated as an escape hatch.** Filtering plaintext DNS is void if the workload can resolve over HTTPS: DoT (853) is therefore always dropped, and blocking DoH over 443 is a one-switch option.

**Fail-closed over best-effort.** If the redirect rules cannot be installed, the sidecar exits instead of running as a silent pass-through; a supervisor restarts it with backoff and a crash-loop breaker. "No enforcement" must never look like enforcement.

**Portable by fallback, honest about limits.** Redirects install through iptables where available and fall back to native nftables on kernels lacking the required extensions (Firecracker-style guest kernels). gVisor's netstack cannot support this mechanism — Kata is the supported secure runtime — and transparent service-mesh sidecars conflict by construction, since both rewrite the same namespace's outbound traffic. These boundaries are explicit, not best-effort.

## Transparent TLS interception (L7)

Layers 1 and 2 decide *whether* a connection may happen; the transparent MITM layer adds control and visibility over *what goes through it*. When enabled, outbound HTTP and HTTPS is redirected into a mitmproxy listener inside the sidecar, which recovers the true destination from connection state and terminates TLS on the sandbox's behalf.

Status: **experimental but production-usable**. The interception, credential-injection, and CA-delivery mechanism is complete and runs in production settings; what remains experimental is the configuration surface — extra ports and diagnostic switches may still change between releases.

::: warning Internal OSEP-0023 bootstrap gate
`OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_EXPERIMENTAL_REVISION_RUNTIME=true` is a development-only,
sidecar-profile gate for the OSEP-0023 revision protocol. Each mitmdump launch
or restart receives a fresh authenticated process session and must acknowledge
the current in-memory Vault snapshot (or the authoritative initial empty state)
before health becomes ready. The default is off.

The authenticated IPC backend jointly installs the immutable snapshot and its
credential-free TLS selector view. Its connection and request admission remain
disabled for the process lifetime, so install acknowledgements and active-revision
readback confirm coherent state only. They do not report transport drain or
completion of a public Vault mutation. Shutdown fences both views together.

This gate does **not** enable credential-bound TLS selection. Existing traffic
still uses intercept-all behavior and the conditional active-Vault lookup;
connection fencing, Fast Sandbox, and the public `interceptionMode` contract are
not wired to the revision protocol yet. To prevent the acknowledged bootstrap
snapshot from diverging from the in-memory Vault, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
on `/credential-vault` return `503` while this internal gate is enabled. An
internal Go transaction owner now coordinates candidate installation and local
Vault finalization, including fail-closed cleanup of the exact process generation
on unresolved outcomes. It is not connected to these HTTP handlers and does not
change the gate or provide transport-drain acknowledgement.

The experimental lifecycle also keeps an authoritative policy base and a
private bootstrap ticket under the shared policy/Vault barrier. Initial startup
and the revision layer's child-restart path use the same final check: the captured policy base,
Store and Vault mutation identity must still be current, the exact child/session
must still belong to the pending attempt, and recovery must not be required.
Snapshot installation or listener availability alone cannot make health ready.
Policy or always-rule publication, including replacement with identical rules,
and Vault changes invalidate an older capture. A rejected attempt stops and reaps
only its own child before closing its session. Without a durable quarantine
owner, a clean restart can capture fresh state and recover. The Docker durable
quarantine lifecycle below instead quarantines child exits and refuses automatic
recovery. Initial startup also retries a stale publication with a fresh
capture, up to three total launch attempts, so an immediate always-rule reload
can settle without forcing the sidecar to exit. Redirect and CA preparation run
once. Other startup errors, cancellation, shutdown, and recovery-required state
stop startup; exhausting the stale-attempt limit leaves health not-ready.

If experimental policy processing attempts a policy-file or nft update and then
fails with an uncertain outcome, or session cleanup cannot be confirmed, the Go
owner latches `recovery-required`. Health stays not-ready, and internal candidate
preparation, Vault mutation ownership and new bootstrap publication are blocked.
Parsing or validation errors before external effects, and ordinary clean child
crashes, do not set this latch. Shutdown and teardown remain available. The first
recovery reason remains sticky for that Go process incarnation; successful
readback, listener checks and ordinary child restarts cannot clear it. There is
no reset API in this increment.

When this gate is enabled and `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_POLICY_FILE` is configured,
policy persistence requires an **egress-owned writable directory mount**. Mount
the directory containing the policy, rather than binding the policy file itself.
The directory must be owned by the egress process's effective UID, owner-writable
and searchable, and not group- or world-writable. Only that egress instance may
write the directory or policy file. Ancestors must be root- or effective-UID-owned
and protected from other writers (shared sticky ancestors such as `/tmp` are
permitted). The parent directory must already exist; egress does not create it,
change host permissions, or migrate existing mounts.

The experimental store requires Linux mount identities from `statx`, or from
`/proc/self/fdinfo` when `statx` mount IDs are unavailable. It rejects single-file bind mounts,
read-only projections, symlinks in the path, non-regular files and hard-linked
files before replacing the original. Unsupported directory/file layouts detected by validation fail startup and are
revalidated for each update. Construction and the pre-update snapshot probe
directory synchronization before replacing the policy file; a later I/O failure
can still require recovery after rename.

Kernel-managed `security.selinux` labels, mutable IMA digest attributes
(`security.ima` digest/digest-ng formats), and EVM HMAC attributes (`security.evm`)
are permitted on existing and newly created files. Egress never copies these
attributes: the kernel assigns or regenerates them for each replacement inode.
For an existing file, the replacement's SELinux label must exactly match the
snapshot label, and any previously present IMA digest/EVM HMAC must be present
again before rename. Signature formats, unknown integrity formats, user xattrs,
file capabilities, other unknown attributes, and file/parent-directory ACLs are
rejected before replacement. Attribute format checks classify this storage
contract; they do not authenticate digests/HMACs or replace kernel appraisal.

Use a dedicated directory whose directory/process SELinux creation policy gives
all randomized sibling temporary files the intended policy label. For an
initially absent policy, that kernel-assigned temporary-inode label becomes the
policy label. Egress does not look up labels for the final basename, run
`restorecon`, or implement filename-specific transitions. A pre-existing custom
or filename-dependent label that differs from the temporary inode is rejected;
Egress never silently relabels it. IMA/EVM deployments must allow the kernel to
regenerate mutable integrity attributes for randomized sibling files under the
same appraisal rules as the final policy path; policies requiring externally
signed replacement files are unsupported. No host security policy is changed.

The operator must use a filesystem that supports
same-directory rename and file/directory synchronization. For example, mount a
prepared host directory at `/var/egress/policy` and configure the file path as
`/var/egress/policy/policy.json`. Keep platform `allow.always`/`deny.always` inputs
outside this exclusively written directory.

An update writes a new temporary inode in that same directory, preserves the
existing file's owner and permission bits (new files use `0600`), synchronizes and
closes the writer, then reopens the same inode read-only with no-follow and
identity checks. This allows last-writer-close IMA updates to finish before final
attribute inspection and another file sync. Only then does it rename over the
policy and synchronize the directory. A known
failure before rename does not write or replace the original: no restore or nft apply is
attempted, and that failure alone does not require recovery or freeze writers.
Once rename is attempted, a failure is conservatively treated as an uncertain
outcome. The owner enters sticky recovery before best-effort restoration. Restore
uses atomic replacement of the exact original bytes, owner and permission bits
with the snapshot SELinux label check. Integrity attributes are regenerated, not
restored byte-for-byte. It uses synchronized
removal when the file did not previously exist. Even successful restoration does
not clear recovery. Temporary files are cleaned up on ordinary error returns;
a process crash may leave a temporary file for operator inspection.

This protocol does not make policy files and nft state one crash-consistent
transaction. The file primitive alone provides no kernel rollback or packet
fence; the experimental lifecycle guard described below owns those boundaries. Existing open file descriptors continue to see the previous inode; readers
must reopen the policy path to observe replacements. Default deployments with the
experimental gate off, including DNS-only mode, retain legacy in-place persistence.
Fast Sandbox does not use this sidecar policy-file store.

Static nft applies classify their kernel effect as `Unchanged`, `Committed`, or
`Unknown`. Local ruleset construction errors, cancellation before starting nft,
and process-start failures are `Unchanged`: no kernel operation was executed.
A successful command is `Committed`. After the process starts, timeout, signal,
nonzero exit, wait or output-copy errors are `Unknown`, as are errors from a
runner without a trusted classification. Diagnostic text and exit status cannot
prove that the kernel stayed unchanged. The existing single missing-table
fallback remains bounded; if both attempts fail, both diagnostics are retained
and an `Unknown` first attempt cannot be downgraded by an `Unchanged` retry.

At the Manager layer, an apply that is `Unchanged` preserves the previous policy
base and DNS/TCP tracking without freezing a healthy Manager. The lifecycle
quarantine owner uses the stricter terminal-failure rule described below once
it has written an operation intent, even for a later `Unchanged` result.
When the policy file was already saved, this requires successful durable restore
of its exact previous bytes, metadata, or absence. Any restore failure requires
recovery, including a failure classified as leaving the *new* file unchanged.
Without a configured policy file, the old base remains retryable directly.
`Unknown` requires recovery before best-effort file restore; successful restore
cannot clear that latch. Failed always-rule reloads keep the previous loader,
proxy and policy base. Bootstrap invalidation and existing recovery or quiescence
are never reversed. Initial enforcement failure still terminates startup,
including an `Unchanged` failure.

In the ordinary sidecar's experimental revision runtime, entering recovery also
synchronously freezes runtime writes in the same nft Manager. A terminal static
apply error with an `Unknown` effect freezes that Manager before releasing its
lock, starting with the first startup apply; an `Unchanged` error or successful
missing-table fallback does not add a freeze. Uncertain policy-file persistence,
failed restoration after a saved file, and session-cleanup failures freeze
it through the recovery owner. The owner publishes the health and bootstrap
restrictions before waiting for an already admitted nft writer, so `/healthz`
can return 503 while that writer drains. The write-admission boundary is the
atomic closure of admission, before waiting for the Manager lock. Queued and
new writers check that gate after acquiring the lock and cannot enter while
recovery waits. An operation admitted before the gate closes may finish its nft
update and associated state publication; the freeze call returns only after
that operation has drained.

The freeze covers six runtime paths: static policy replacement (`ApplyStatic`),
direct dynamic IP additions (`AddResolvedIPs`), DNS answer
publication (`AddResolvedDomain`), late domain-refresh results
(`applyDomainRefresh`), active TCP lease renewal, and upstream proxy address
updates (`AddUpstreamProxyIPs`). DNS queries already in flight may complete,
but their results cannot write rules or republish old authorization state.
Stopping lease renewal can reduce workload availability; DNS-learned upstream
proxy addresses can expire and cause later proxy connections to fail. Existing
connections are not necessarily disconnected by the freeze.

There is no unfreeze operation. Explicit shutdown `RemoveEnforcement` can still
delete the nft table, whether cleanup succeeds or fails, and never clears the
Manager's frozen state. The Manager freeze alone is not a packet fence: existing rules and established
connections may still allow traffic. The experimental lifecycle owner therefore
uses a separate quarantine table that this teardown cannot remove. Neither
mechanism rolls back unknown effects or adds a hard shutdown deadline. Legacy
sidecar and Fast Sandbox behavior remain unchanged when the experiment is off.

Kernel write-admission validation uses
`TestNftQuiescenceAfterCommittedStaticError` in a separate Linux network
namespace. It commits a new ruleset through the real nft runner before injecting
an error, then checks that all six runtime paths leave the new static policy and
empty dynamic/upstream sets unchanged. It requires `nft`, `unshare`, and
permissions to create a network namespace and operate nftables. The privileged
egress CI explicitly selects it alongside `TestDynamicElementRenewal`,
`TestNftStartFailurePreservesKernelAndRetry`, `TestNftRealMissingTableFallback`,
and the owner-level `TestRevisionNftEffectsRealFileAndKernel` with
`OPENSANDBOX_NFT_TEST=1`. The owner test uses real atomic Save/Restore with both
prior bytes and prior absence, alongside a real production start failure or a
lost result after an actual kernel commit. The dedicated nft runner checks exact
test discovery and each test's RUN/PASS evidence and rejects any SKIP;
missing prerequisites fail enabled tests. Ordinary
Go tests skip kernel validation when that variable is unset, so their success
does not establish kernel behavior or packet isolation.

The readiness and Manager state remain process-local. Durable quarantine adds
a separate restart boundary below; it does not replay policy, Vault or dynamic
DNS state. Active policy epochs remain zero; legacy policy success responses
are not revision transaction acknowledgements.
:::

### Experimental durable quarantine (Docker only)

The administrator can set `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_EXPERIMENTAL_REVISION_RUNTIME=true`
on the lifecycle server process. It is not an allowed sandbox request environment
variable. Eligible Docker sandboxes must have a network policy, `dns+nft`
enforcement and transparent MITM. A request without a network policy does not
activate the experiment. Other runtimes are rejected while the server gate is
on. Pause, resume and snapshots of protected sandboxes are rejected; no recovery
contract exists for those operations.

The supported deployment keeps the existing two-container topology: the workload
joins the egress sidecar's network namespace. There is no separate namespace
anchor. A Go process restart within that same namespace and a whole sidecar
container restart therefore have different isolation guarantees.

Before starting the sidecar, the trusted Docker owner allocates a unique,
host-backed named volume, mounts it only at
`/var/lib/opensandbox-egress/quarantine` in a network-disabled provisioning helper,
and creates an exclusive initial record bound to a random incarnation. The
helper uses the same egress image, drops all capabilities, and exits before the
sidecar starts. It does not prefill a network namespace binding: its own namespace
is not the workload's target. The workload receives neither this volume nor the
identity.
The shared `/opt/opensandbox` volume and temporary revision IPC directory are
not trusted recovery storage. Do not attach the private volume to a workload,
use tmpfs, copy a fresh record between sandboxes, reuse a previous incarnation's
volume, or manually provision a live namespace. Supported storage is local ext4,
XFS, Btrfs or durable-backed overlay;
filesystem synchronization is required and is not a multi-resource transaction.

At the first `fresh` → `guarded` transition, the real sidecar durably binds the
record to the host boot ID and the device/inode identity of its network namespace.
This binding is immutable. The supervisor's experimental prestart hook confirms
the independent `inet opensandbox_quarantine` table in that target before
consuming the one-use fresh record or removing stale redirect rules. The worker
verifies the binding, confirms the fence again and consumes the guarded record
before startup effects. Missing, corrupt, mismatched, unsupported, unwritable or
previously consumed records refuse worker startup. Missing credentials or a new
directory never imply an authoritative empty Vault.

A later Go process restart can confirm full-IP quarantine only while it remains
in the recorded network namespace. Its consumed record prevents automatic worker
recovery. A whole sidecar container restart may instead create a different
namespace, even when the Docker container ID is unchanged, while the old workload
still occupies the original namespace. On a binding mismatch, the original
target's isolation is `QuarantineUnknown` and rebuilding is required. The guard
refuses redirect cleanup and worker startup. A fence installed in a replacement
namespace must never be reported as isolation of the original workload.

The old workload is not recoverable under this contract. The operator must
destroy the old sandbox and use trusted creation for a new one; the program does
not automatically destroy it. Replaying state, editing the record or restarting
repeatedly is not recovery. There is no reset API.

The binding does not use a PID, so PID reuse is irrelevant. A changed boot ID is
conservatively rejected. Namespace device/inode values are not permanent
identifiers across namespace lifetimes, including possible inode reuse within
one boot. The trusted unique incarnation and never-reused private volume remain
required; the namespace tuple alone cannot establish first creation or authorize
reuse.

Within the verified target namespace, the fence drops IPv4 and IPv6 at input,
output and forward hooks, including
loopback, existing TCP, new connections, UDP, marked traffic, the MITM UID,
DNS and upstream-proxy exceptions. Business traffic, health/control HTTP and
execd IP connections become unreachable. `QuarantineConfirmed` means both the
immutable namespace binding and exact kernel fence readback matched the target;
`QuarantineUnknown` means isolation of that target could not be established.
Neither process exit nor a 503 response proves isolation.
Readiness, writer quiescence and packet isolation are independent states.
This does not protect against workloads with NET_ADMIN/NET_RAW or other
privileges that bypass the supported inet path, or against L2/offloaded paths.
It does not promise zero leakage between an unfenced process death and guard
detection. Fence installation failure has no external workload-kill fallback.

A default-bridge probe on Docker 29.1.3 with runc 1.4.0 observed that a whole
sidecar container restart removed the old workload namespace's `eth0` and routes.
New TCP connections to a separate peer on the same default bridge were
unreachable, and an existing connection to that peer timed out; loopback remained
reachable. No Internet destination was tested. This is a result for that
tested runtime and topology, not a full-IP quarantine guarantee or evidence that
other runtimes isolate the old namespace safely. The remaining real-image CI
validation is pending.

Policy, always-rule and internal Vault changes write durable intent before
confirming the fence and beginning dangerous effects. The owner durably records
completion before removing and confirming absence of the fence; readiness is
published last, with versioned tickets preventing a concurrent child exit from
reviving old readiness. Once intent starts, any unresolved failure is terminal,
even when a lower-level effect is classified `Unchanged`. No digest is used as
an authoritative policy or Vault source. Initial listener verification reads
kernel socket ownership for the exact mitmdump child without a loopback-packet
exception. A child exit enters quarantine rather than automatically restarting.

Normal shutdown first quarantines and then cleans ordinary enforcement and
redirects. Old-generation cleanup, policy replacement and `RemoveEnforcement`
never delete the quarantine table or lifecycle intent. If the target binding or
isolation cannot be confirmed, shutdown refuses redirect cleanup. Destroy both
old containers and ensure the protected namespace is gone before downgrading the
image or reclaiming its private volume. Restarting only the sidecar does not
establish that boundary. The experimental gate off retains legacy
prestart cleanup and restart behavior.

**Trust is delivered, not disabled.** The sidecar exports its CA, and the sandbox bootstrap installs it into the system, NSS, and JDK trust stores on a best-effort basis — clients keep certificate verification on (`curl` without `-k`), and traffic stays encrypted end-to-end from the sandbox's point of view. Images that run Chromium-family browsers should ship the native `certutil` package so the per-user NSS store can be updated.

**What it enables:**

- **Credential Vault** — injection happens when request headers are read, so it applies regardless of body size, including fully streamed uploads.
- **TLS-level observability** — optional request-level outcome metrics (decrypt / passthrough) for targeted diagnostic windows.

**Extendable at L7: custom mitmproxy addons.** The interception layer is not closed. The sidecar always loads its bundled system addon first, then any additional mitmproxy addons listed — comma-separated — in `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_MITMPROXY_SCRIPT`, in the order given. Addons are standard mitmproxy scripts with access to the full L7 hook surface: hostname, HTTP method, URI path, headers, and bodies of every intercepted request and response. Operators can therefore build a custom egress image that adds arbitrary L7 policies on top of the built-in FQDN and credential machinery — fine-grained hostname, method, URI, or header filtering, custom header injection, request rewriting — as ordinary Python addons. The system addon keeps its position ahead of user addons, so the built-in behavior is fully in place before any custom logic runs.

**Chained upstream proxy.** Setting `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_UPSTREAM_PROXY` to `http://host[:port]` or `https://host[:port]` on the egress container chains all mitmproxy-handled egress through that proxy via `CONNECT`, optionally with `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_UPSTREAM_PROXY_AUTH` (a complete `Proxy-Authorization` header value). The endpoint accepts only a host and optional port (or a single `/` path); credentials, query, fragment, and other paths are rejected, and validation errors do not include the supplied URL. The host must be a literal IP or a dotted domain name — a dotless name expands differently through the pod resolver's DNS search list than through the egress's direct query, so the containment sets could miss the address actually dialed. The `CONNECT` authority is the SNI/Host-derived FQDN when known. This is fail closed: pass-through flows that cannot be chained (no-SNI, `ignore_hosts`/`tcp_hosts`/`udp_hosts` matches, UDP) are refused rather than sent direct. Chaining requires transparent MITM; outside the fast-sandbox profile it also requires `dns+nft` enforcement, and invalid combinations fail startup before the proxy hostname is registered for infrastructure DNS. Under `dns+nft`, the proxy endpoint is reachable only from the mitmproxy process (UID-, IP-, and port-scoped nft rules), never through the sandbox allow sets; hostname endpoints resolve through an infrastructure DNS path that bypasses sandbox policy evaluation. Literal proxy IPs remain permanently seeded in those scoped sets; DNS-learned addresses use explicit bounded TTLs. On Docker and Kubernetes, administrators configure it via the server's `[egress.upstream_proxy]` section — see [server configuration](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/server/configuration.md#egress). The same section can deliver an extra CA bundle (a Docker host PEM path or a Kubernetes Secret mounted read-only into the egress sidecar only) that mitmproxy trusts in addition to — never instead of — the system roots, for every upstream TLS verification. For configuration, runtime, rotation, and troubleshooting procedures, see [Chained Upstream Proxy Operations](/guides/egress-upstream-proxy).

Under the fast-sandbox profile the same chaining applies to the shared mitmproxy, with containment adapted to the source-IP enforcement model: the proxy endpoint is dropped profile-wide in the shared dispatch chain (forward and input paths, ahead of the per-subject rules), so no subject policy — default-allow included — can CONNECT the proxy directly, while the locally generated mitmproxy dial is unaffected. A hostname endpoint is registered as an infrastructure domain on the shared DNS proxy so its answers never feed the dynamic allow sets; the shared mitmdump resolves the name through the fastlet pod's own resolver, so it must be resolvable via cluster DNS. Because the shared DNS proxy's forward upstreams and the pod resolver can return different address sets (split-horizon or operator-configured DNS), the egress queries both authorities concurrently and seeds the containment drop sets with the union. Drop elements are permanent (no kernel timeout): containment persists through egress downtime. An address is pruned only after it is absent from two successful refreshes of both authorities; a sandbox DNS lookup renews its retention. Partial resolver failures are logged and any returned addresses are added without pruning existing elements. Startup resolves and seeds the in-memory addresses with bounded retries **before resetting the nft table**. Both authorities must complete successfully and their union must be nonempty; otherwise startup fails and the previous kernel table is left intact. The reset installs the seeded addresses atomically, and nft updates have a separate timeout from DNS resolution. On Docker and Kubernetes sidecar deployments administrators configure the server's `[egress.upstream_proxy]` section; fast-sandbox deployments set the two environment variables on the fastlet pod's egress container directly.

**Scope notes:**

- Ports 80 and 443 are always intercepted; a bounded list of extra ports can be added. Vault binding matching currently fires on 80/443 only — extra ports are decrypted and logged but not credentialed.
- IPv6 destinations are intercepted alongside IPv4 (listeners and redirect rules cover both address families).
- A not-yet-initialized proxy is visible in health: the sidecar answers `503 mitmproxy not ready` rather than passing traffic unexamined.
- One known upstream behavior: an SSE body larger than ~1 MB can be truncated when the origin closes the connection with a TCP RST mid-body — standard TCP semantics, not an interception bug. See [Egress SSE Truncation](/guides/egress-sse-truncation).

## Credentials without secrets in the sandbox

With transparent TLS interception enabled, the sidecar can inject credentials into outbound requests that match a vault binding — bearer tokens, basic auth, API keys, or custom headers. The vault lives in the sidecar's memory only: the sandbox workload sees authenticated traffic but never holds the secret itself. See [Credential Vault](/guides/credential-vault).

## Where it runs

| Deployment | Shape |
|---|---|
| Docker | A separate sidecar container; the sandbox joins the sidecar's network namespace |
| Kubernetes | The sidecar is appended to the sandbox pod and holds the pod's only `NET_ADMIN` |
| Pooled sandboxes | Pre-warmed pods cannot gain a sidecar per request — put required controls in the Pool template (per-request `networkPolicy` + pool references are rejected) |
| Fast Sandbox | A shared egress process per Fastlet pod, one subject per sandbox — see [Fast Sandbox: Networking](/architecture/fast-sandbox/networking) |

## Service Mesh Compatibility

::: warning Not supported with transparent mesh sidecars
Egress is designed to be the only transparent outbound interception layer in the sandbox's network namespace. Deployments that inject a service-mesh sidecar (Istio/Envoy and similar) into the same pod are not currently supported for egress features.
:::

Both layers rewrite outbound traffic in the same namespace, so per-sandbox policy, transparent MITM, and Credential Vault cannot be relied on alongside mesh injection. Prefer excluding sandbox pods from mesh injection, or enforce outbound policy with a CNI-level mechanism instead. The same constraint applies to gVisor: its netstack does not implement the redirect mechanism egress requires — use a Kata runtime, which provides comparable isolation and full egress support (see the [compatibility matrix](/guides/secure-container#compatibility-matrix)).

## Shutdown

On shutdown, the sidecar keeps DNS and network rules working while in-flight deliveries finish (a bounded window), then removes its network rules and flushes telemetry. Delivery is best effort — forced termination can drop events. Under Docker, deletion gives the sidecar a 9-second stop budget before forced termination. A lightweight supervisor restarts the sidecar on crash with exponential backoff and a crash-loop breaker, and cleans stale redirect state before a fresh start.

## Observability (OpenTelemetry)

When the platform configures an OTLP endpoint, the sidecar exports per-sandbox metrics: denied request counts, DNS query outcomes (denied-by-policy and resolver-failure are deliberately separate counters — alerting on the wrong one inverts the diagnosis), nftables update failures, and process resource usage. Cardinality is bounded: no queried domain or destination ever becomes a label. See the [egress OpenTelemetry reference](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/components/egress/docs/opentelemetry.md) and [component telemetry](/guides/component-telemetry).
