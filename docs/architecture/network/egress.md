# Egress

Egress is how a sandbox gets a network policy instead of open internet access. It runs as a sidecar sharing the sandbox's network namespace, so every outbound packet passes it — no application configuration, and no way around it from inside the sandbox. Policy is declared at create time (`networkPolicy`) or by the platform, and enforced continuously.

## Capabilities at a glance

| Capability | What you get |
|---|---|
| FQDN rules | Allow or deny by domain, wildcard (`*.pypi.org`), IP, or CIDR |
| DNS filtering (default) | Denied domains fail resolution; allowed ones resolve normally |
| Network enforcement (`dns+nft`) | Strict default-deny at the packet layer, fed by DNS-resolved addresses with bounded leases |
| Platform overlays | Operator-set `deny.always` / `allow.always` floors that user policy cannot override |
| Credential Vault | Secrets stay in the sidecar; credentials are injected into matching outbound requests |
| Transparent TLS interception (L7) | See, control, and authenticate outbound HTTPS — production-usable mechanism, experimental configuration surface |
| Fail-closed startup | If enforcement cannot be installed, the sidecar exits — it never runs as a no-op |

## How interception works

**Layer 1 — DNS.** All port-53 traffic is redirected into the sidecar's DNS proxy. A denied domain answers `NXDOMAIN`; an allowed domain resolves through to the real upstream, and its resolved addresses are recorded.

**Layer 2 — Network (`dns+nft` mode).** nftables drops everything not explicitly allowed. Allowed traffic passes by static rule or by DNS-learned address sets: a resolved IP receives a bounded lease (with a grace window for active TCP connections), so "allowed" never silently becomes "allowed forever". UDP and QUIC flows rely on DNS lease timing alone.

**Precedence.** First matching rule wins, in this order: platform `deny.always`, platform `allow.always`, then your policy — so the platform's deny always beats your allow. The overlays live in files inside the sidecar image and hot-reload every minute. A reload publishes the parsed pair only after the corresponding nftables static policy is accepted; parse or apply failures keep the active in-memory rules. Failures remain eligible for retry unless the experimental revision runtime requires recovery, as described below. Your policy is set per sandbox and can be mutated at runtime (add, replace, remove by target) through the API the SDKs expose.

## Design decisions

**Enforcement lives in the data path, not beside it.** The sidecar shares the sandbox's network namespace and installs redirect rules there, so every packet passes the policy engine without application cooperation — and without the option to bypass it, because the workload holds no `NET_ADMIN` in that namespace.

**Two layers, two costs.** DNS filtering alone is cheap and universal, but it only gates names: an application that obtains an address by other means is not covered. The `dns+nft` layer adds packet-level truth — default-deny with DNS-learned exceptions that carry bounded leases (renewed while a TCP connection is active), so "allowed" never quietly becomes "allowed forever".

**Encrypted DNS is treated as an escape hatch.** Filtering plaintext DNS is void if the workload can resolve over HTTPS: DoT (853) is therefore always dropped, and blocking DoH over 443 is a one-switch option.

**Fail-closed over best-effort.** If the redirect rules cannot be installed, the sidecar exits instead of running as a silent pass-through; a supervisor restarts it with backoff and a crash-loop breaker. "No enforcement" must never look like enforcement.

**Portable by fallback, honest about limits.** Redirects install through iptables where available and fall back to native nftables on kernels lacking the required extensions (Firecracker-style guest kernels). gVisor's netstack cannot support this mechanism — Kata is the supported secure runtime — and transparent service-mesh sidecars conflict by construction, since both rewrite the same namespace's outbound traffic. These boundaries are explicit, not best-effort.

## Transparent TLS interception (L7)

Layers 1 and 2 decide *whether* a connection may happen; the transparent MITM layer adds control and visibility over *what goes through it*. When enabled, outbound HTTP and HTTPS is redirected into a mitmproxy listener inside the sidecar, which recovers the true destination from connection state and terminates TLS on the sandbox's behalf.

Status: **experimental but production-usable**. The interception, credential-injection, and CA-delivery mechanism is complete and runs in production settings; what remains experimental is the configuration surface — extra ports and diagnostic switches may still change between releases.

::: warning Internal OSEP-0023 bootstrap gate
`OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_EXPERIMENTAL_REVISION_RUNTIME=true` is a development-only,
sidecar-profile gate for the OSEP-0023 revision protocol. Each mitmdump launch
or restart receives a fresh authenticated process session and must acknowledge
the current in-memory Vault snapshot (or the authoritative initial empty state)
before health becomes ready. The default is off.

The authenticated IPC backend jointly installs the immutable snapshot and its
credential-free TLS selector view. Its connection and request admission remain
disabled for the process lifetime, so install acknowledgements and active-revision
readback confirm coherent state only. They do not report transport drain or
completion of a public Vault mutation. Shutdown fences both views together.

This gate does **not** enable credential-bound TLS selection. Existing traffic
still uses intercept-all behavior and the conditional active-Vault lookup;
connection fencing, Fast Sandbox, and the public `interceptionMode` contract are
not wired to the revision protocol yet. To prevent the acknowledged bootstrap
snapshot from diverging from the in-memory Vault, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
on `/credential-vault` return `503` while this internal gate is enabled. An
internal Go transaction owner now coordinates candidate installation and local
Vault finalization, including fail-closed cleanup of the exact process generation
on unresolved outcomes. It is not connected to these HTTP handlers and does not
change the gate or provide transport-drain acknowledgement.

The experimental lifecycle also keeps an authoritative policy base and a
private bootstrap ticket under the shared policy/Vault barrier. Initial startup
and automatic child restart use the same final check: the captured policy base,
Store and Vault mutation identity must still be current, the exact child/session
must still belong to the pending attempt, and recovery must not be required.
Snapshot installation or listener availability alone cannot make health ready.
Policy or always-rule publication, including replacement with identical rules,
and Vault changes invalidate an older capture. A rejected attempt stops and reaps
only its own child before closing its session; a clean restart can capture fresh
state and recover. Initial startup also retries a stale publication with a fresh
capture, up to three total launch attempts, so an immediate always-rule reload
can settle without forcing the sidecar to exit. Redirect and CA preparation run
once. Other startup errors, cancellation, shutdown, and recovery-required state
stop startup; exhausting the stale-attempt limit leaves health not-ready.

If experimental policy processing attempts a policy-file or nft update and then
fails with an uncertain outcome, or session cleanup cannot be confirmed, the Go
owner latches `recovery-required`. Health stays not-ready, and internal candidate
preparation, Vault mutation ownership and new bootstrap publication are blocked.
Parsing or validation errors before external effects, and ordinary clean child
crashes, do not set this latch. Shutdown and teardown remain available. The first
recovery reason remains sticky for that Go process incarnation; successful
readback, listener checks and ordinary child restarts cannot clear it. There is
no reset API in this increment.

When this gate is enabled and `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_POLICY_FILE` is configured,
policy persistence requires an **egress-owned writable directory mount**. Mount
the directory containing the policy, rather than binding the policy file itself.
The directory must be owned by the egress process's effective UID, owner-writable
and searchable, and not group- or world-writable. Only that egress instance may
write the directory or policy file. Ancestors must be root- or effective-UID-owned
and protected from other writers (shared sticky ancestors such as `/tmp` are
permitted). The parent directory must already exist; egress does not create it,
change host permissions, or migrate existing mounts.

The experimental store requires Linux mount identities from `statx`, or from
`/proc/self/fdinfo` when `statx` mount IDs are unavailable. It rejects single-file bind mounts,
read-only projections, symlinks in the path, non-regular files and hard-linked
files before replacing the original. Unsupported directory/file layouts detected by validation fail startup and are
revalidated for each update. Construction and the pre-update snapshot probe
directory synchronization before replacing the policy file; a later I/O failure
can still require recovery after rename. Existing file extended attributes (including ACLs
and SELinux labels), parent-directory ACLs, and inherited temporary-file extended
attributes are unsupported and rejected rather than silently discarded. This
includes SELinux-labeled container storage; the experimental gate must remain off
for such layouts. Egress does not remove labels or change host security policy.
The operator must use a filesystem that supports
same-directory rename and file/directory synchronization. For example, mount a
prepared host directory at `/var/egress/policy` and configure the file path as
`/var/egress/policy/policy.json`. Keep platform `allow.always`/`deny.always` inputs
outside this exclusively written directory.

An update writes a new temporary inode in that same directory, preserves the
existing file's owner and permission bits (new files use `0600`), synchronizes and
closes it, renames it over the policy, then synchronizes the directory. A known
failure before rename leaves the original untouched: no restore or nft apply is
attempted, and that failure alone does not require recovery or freeze writers.
Once rename is attempted, a failure is conservatively treated as an uncertain
outcome. The owner enters sticky recovery before best-effort restoration. Restore
uses atomic replacement of the exact original bytes and metadata, or synchronized
removal when the file did not previously exist. Even successful restoration does
not clear recovery. Temporary files are cleaned up on ordinary error returns;
a process crash may leave a temporary file for operator inspection.

This protocol does not make policy files and nft state one crash-consistent
transaction. It provides no durable recovery journal, kernel rollback or packet
fence. Existing open file descriptors continue to see the previous inode; readers
must reopen the policy path to observe replacements. Default deployments with the
experimental gate off, including DNS-only mode, retain legacy in-place persistence.
An experimental owner without a configured policy file retains its existing
behavior. Fast Sandbox does not use this sidecar policy-file store.

In the ordinary sidecar's experimental revision runtime, entering recovery also
synchronously freezes runtime writes in the same nft Manager. A terminal static
apply error freezes that Manager before releasing its lock, starting with the
first startup apply; a successful missing-table fallback remains a success and
does not freeze it. Uncertain policy-file persistence and session-cleanup failures freeze
it through the recovery owner. The owner publishes the health and bootstrap
restrictions before waiting for an already admitted nft writer, so `/healthz`
can return 503 while that writer drains. The write-admission boundary is the
atomic closure of admission, before waiting for the Manager lock. Queued and
new writers check that gate after acquiring the lock and cannot enter while
recovery waits. An operation admitted before the gate closes may finish its nft
update and associated state publication; the freeze call returns only after
that operation has drained.

The freeze covers six runtime paths: static policy replacement (`ApplyStatic`),
direct dynamic IP additions (`AddResolvedIPs`), DNS answer
publication (`AddResolvedDomain`), late domain-refresh results
(`applyDomainRefresh`), active TCP lease renewal, and upstream proxy address
updates (`AddUpstreamProxyIPs`). DNS queries already in flight may complete,
but their results cannot write rules or republish old authorization state.
Stopping lease renewal can reduce workload availability; DNS-learned upstream
proxy addresses can expire and cause later proxy connections to fail. Existing
connections are not necessarily disconnected by the freeze.

There is no unfreeze operation. Explicit shutdown `RemoveEnforcement` can still
delete the nft table, whether cleanup succeeds or fails, and never clears the
Manager's frozen state. This does not provide a packet fence: existing rules,
leased addresses and established connections may still allow traffic, and
teardown may remove enforcement. The freeze does not survive process restart,
roll back unknown external effects, or add a hard shutdown deadline. Legacy
sidecar and Fast Sandbox behavior are unchanged; dns-only recovery keeps its
existing readiness behavior without requiring an nft Manager.

Kernel write-admission validation uses
`TestNftQuiescenceAfterCommittedStaticError` in a separate Linux network
namespace. It commits a new ruleset through the real nft runner before injecting
an error, then checks that all six runtime paths leave the new static policy and
empty dynamic/upstream sets unchanged. It requires `nft`, `unshare`, and
permissions to create a network namespace and operate nftables. The privileged
egress CI explicitly selects it alongside `TestDynamicElementRenewal` with
`OPENSANDBOX_NFT_TEST=1`; missing prerequisites fail the enabled tests. Ordinary
Go tests skip kernel validation when that variable is unset, so their success
does not establish kernel behavior or packet isolation.

This state is in memory only. Readiness is not a network-traffic fence, and this
increment provides no atomic policy-file/nft rollback, dynamic DNS-state recovery
or whole-process crash durability. Restarting the entire sidecar loses the latch
and is not a verified safe recovery procedure. Active policy epochs remain zero;
legacy policy success responses are not revision transaction acknowledgements.
:::

**Trust is delivered, not disabled.** The sidecar exports its CA, and the sandbox bootstrap installs it into the system, NSS, and JDK trust stores on a best-effort basis — clients keep certificate verification on (`curl` without `-k`), and traffic stays encrypted end-to-end from the sandbox's point of view. Images that run Chromium-family browsers should ship the native `certutil` package so the per-user NSS store can be updated.

**What it enables:**

- **Credential Vault** — injection happens when request headers are read, so it applies regardless of body size, including fully streamed uploads.
- **TLS-level observability** — optional request-level outcome metrics (decrypt / passthrough) for targeted diagnostic windows.

**Extendable at L7: custom mitmproxy addons.** The interception layer is not closed. The sidecar always loads its bundled system addon first, then any additional mitmproxy addons listed — comma-separated — in `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_MITMPROXY_SCRIPT`, in the order given. Addons are standard mitmproxy scripts with access to the full L7 hook surface: hostname, HTTP method, URI path, headers, and bodies of every intercepted request and response. Operators can therefore build a custom egress image that adds arbitrary L7 policies on top of the built-in FQDN and credential machinery — fine-grained hostname, method, URI, or header filtering, custom header injection, request rewriting — as ordinary Python addons. The system addon keeps its position ahead of user addons, so the built-in behavior is fully in place before any custom logic runs.

**Chained upstream proxy.** Setting `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_UPSTREAM_PROXY` to `http://host[:port]` or `https://host[:port]` on the egress container chains all mitmproxy-handled egress through that proxy via `CONNECT`, optionally with `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_UPSTREAM_PROXY_AUTH` (a complete `Proxy-Authorization` header value). The endpoint accepts only a host and optional port (or a single `/` path); credentials, query, fragment, and other paths are rejected, and validation errors do not include the supplied URL. The host must be a literal IP or a dotted domain name — a dotless name expands differently through the pod resolver's DNS search list than through the egress's direct query, so the containment sets could miss the address actually dialed. The `CONNECT` authority is the SNI/Host-derived FQDN when known. This is fail closed: pass-through flows that cannot be chained (no-SNI, `ignore_hosts`/`tcp_hosts`/`udp_hosts` matches, UDP) are refused rather than sent direct. Chaining requires transparent MITM; outside the fast-sandbox profile it also requires `dns+nft` enforcement, and invalid combinations fail startup before the proxy hostname is registered for infrastructure DNS. Under `dns+nft`, the proxy endpoint is reachable only from the mitmproxy process (UID-, IP-, and port-scoped nft rules), never through the sandbox allow sets; hostname endpoints resolve through an infrastructure DNS path that bypasses sandbox policy evaluation. Literal proxy IPs remain permanently seeded in those scoped sets; DNS-learned addresses use explicit bounded TTLs. On Docker and Kubernetes, administrators configure it via the server's `[egress.upstream_proxy]` section — see [server configuration](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/server/configuration.md#egress). The same section can deliver an extra CA bundle (a Docker host PEM path or a Kubernetes Secret mounted read-only into the egress sidecar only) that mitmproxy trusts in addition to — never instead of — the system roots, for every upstream TLS verification. For configuration, runtime, rotation, and troubleshooting procedures, see [Chained Upstream Proxy Operations](/guides/egress-upstream-proxy).

Under the fast-sandbox profile the same chaining applies to the shared mitmproxy, with containment adapted to the source-IP enforcement model: the proxy endpoint is dropped profile-wide in the shared dispatch chain (forward and input paths, ahead of the per-subject rules), so no subject policy — default-allow included — can CONNECT the proxy directly, while the locally generated mitmproxy dial is unaffected. A hostname endpoint is registered as an infrastructure domain on the shared DNS proxy so its answers never feed the dynamic allow sets; the shared mitmdump resolves the name through the fastlet pod's own resolver, so it must be resolvable via cluster DNS. Because the shared DNS proxy's forward upstreams and the pod resolver can return different address sets (split-horizon or operator-configured DNS), the egress queries both authorities concurrently and seeds the containment drop sets with the union. Drop elements are permanent (no kernel timeout): containment persists through egress downtime. An address is pruned only after it is absent from two successful refreshes of both authorities; a sandbox DNS lookup renews its retention. Partial resolver failures are logged and any returned addresses are added without pruning existing elements. Startup resolves and seeds the in-memory addresses with bounded retries **before resetting the nft table**. Both authorities must complete successfully and their union must be nonempty; otherwise startup fails and the previous kernel table is left intact. The reset installs the seeded addresses atomically, and nft updates have a separate timeout from DNS resolution. On Docker and Kubernetes sidecar deployments administrators configure the server's `[egress.upstream_proxy]` section; fast-sandbox deployments set the two environment variables on the fastlet pod's egress container directly.

**Scope notes:**

- Ports 80 and 443 are always intercepted; a bounded list of extra ports can be added. Vault binding matching currently fires on 80/443 only — extra ports are decrypted and logged but not credentialed.
- IPv6 destinations are intercepted alongside IPv4 (listeners and redirect rules cover both address families).
- A not-yet-initialized proxy is visible in health: the sidecar answers `503 mitmproxy not ready` rather than passing traffic unexamined.
- One known upstream behavior: an SSE body larger than ~1 MB can be truncated when the origin closes the connection with a TCP RST mid-body — standard TCP semantics, not an interception bug. See [Egress SSE Truncation](/guides/egress-sse-truncation).

## Credentials without secrets in the sandbox

With transparent TLS interception enabled, the sidecar can inject credentials into outbound requests that match a vault binding — bearer tokens, basic auth, API keys, or custom headers. The vault lives in the sidecar's memory only: the sandbox workload sees authenticated traffic but never holds the secret itself. See [Credential Vault](/guides/credential-vault).

## Where it runs

| Deployment | Shape |
|---|---|
| Docker | A separate sidecar container; the sandbox joins the sidecar's network namespace |
| Kubernetes | The sidecar is appended to the sandbox pod and holds the pod's only `NET_ADMIN` |
| Pooled sandboxes | Pre-warmed pods cannot gain a sidecar per request — put required controls in the Pool template (per-request `networkPolicy` + pool references are rejected) |
| Fast Sandbox | A shared egress process per Fastlet pod, one subject per sandbox — see [Fast Sandbox: Networking](/architecture/fast-sandbox/networking) |

## Service Mesh Compatibility

::: warning Not supported with transparent mesh sidecars
Egress is designed to be the only transparent outbound interception layer in the sandbox's network namespace. Deployments that inject a service-mesh sidecar (Istio/Envoy and similar) into the same pod are not currently supported for egress features.
:::

Both layers rewrite outbound traffic in the same namespace, so per-sandbox policy, transparent MITM, and Credential Vault cannot be relied on alongside mesh injection. Prefer excluding sandbox pods from mesh injection, or enforce outbound policy with a CNI-level mechanism instead. The same constraint applies to gVisor: its netstack does not implement the redirect mechanism egress requires — use a Kata runtime, which provides comparable isolation and full egress support (see the [compatibility matrix](/guides/secure-container#compatibility-matrix)).

## Shutdown

On shutdown, the sidecar keeps DNS and network rules working while in-flight deliveries finish (a bounded window), then removes its network rules and flushes telemetry. Delivery is best effort — forced termination can drop events. Under Docker, deletion gives the sidecar a 9-second stop budget before forced termination. A lightweight supervisor restarts the sidecar on crash with exponential backoff and a crash-loop breaker, and cleans stale redirect state before a fresh start.

## Observability (OpenTelemetry)

When the platform configures an OTLP endpoint, the sidecar exports per-sandbox metrics: denied request counts, DNS query outcomes (denied-by-policy and resolver-failure are deliberately separate counters — alerting on the wrong one inverts the diagnosis), nftables update failures, and process resource usage. Cardinality is bounded: no queried domain or destination ever becomes a label. See the [egress OpenTelemetry reference](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/components/egress/docs/opentelemetry.md) and [component telemetry](/guides/component-telemetry).
